# CRAB_EM
This repository pertains to Gabriel Sher's MSc Thesis at the Delft University of Technology. It contains a forked version of the update Climate-economy Regional Agent-Based (CRAB) model developed by @TabernaA and @lizverbeek. It then adds an analysis layer using the philosophy of exploratory modeling. Specifically, scenario discovery (a decision-making under deep uncertainty method) is used to try to explain the model's state space and identify tipping points at the boundaries of its states.

My additions lie mostly in the [analysis/](analysis/) folder, though some also in the root folder ([generate_scenarios.py](generate_scenarios.py), [ema_run.py](ema_run.py),  [ema_model.py](ema_model.py), and [ema_data_collection.py](ema_data_collection.py), plus some adaptations in the model and agent code to enable parametrization of the model.)

To use, you might have to create an `img/` folder with a `png/` and `svg/` subfolder. You can adapt the `save_fig()` method in [analysis/plotting.py](analysis/plotting.py) to use a file structure that works better for you.
